# OpenDAIRV2X
## Introduction
To accelerate computer vision research and innovation for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous
Driving (VICAD), we release DAIR-V2X Dataset, which is
the first large-scale, multi-modality, multi-view dataset from
real scenarios for VICAD.
Furtherly, we introduce the Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative 3D
Object Detection (VIC3D) task, which formulate the problem of cooperatively locating and identifying 3D
objects using sensory inputs from both vehicle and infrastructure.
To resolve the VIC3D object detection task and facilitate future research, 
we also introduce our VIC3D object detection benchmark as well as an extensive 3D detection benchmark for those who are interested in Single-View (SV) 3D detection tasks.
In order to facilitate researchers to use the dataset and reproduce the entire benchmark,
we open source the OpenDAIRV2X, towards serving VICAD research community.

## Major features 
- **Support Train/Evaluation for VIC3D**

  It will directly support model training and evaluation for VIC3D. 
  Now the model inference and model training are mainly based on MMDetection3D, which is not quite convenient to carry the VICAD research.
